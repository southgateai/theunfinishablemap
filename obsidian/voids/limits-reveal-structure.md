Instead of treating cognitive limits as obstacles to overcome, multiple philosophical traditions converge on an inverted insight: the *shape* of our limitations reveals the *structure* of our minds. What we cannot think is as informative about cognitive architecture as what we can. For the [[voids|voids project]], this transforms the mapping of unthinkable territory from an exercise in frustration into a method of self-knowledge.

Chomsky, McGinn, Nagel, Kant, and evolutionary epistemology all arrive independently at this conclusion. The endowment that yields scope also establishes limits. Any mind powerful enough to think some thoughts is thereby prevented from thinking others. The pattern of mysteries illuminates the architecture of the mystery-haver.

## Scope Implies Limits

Noam Chomsky's distinction between "problems" and "mysteries" articulates the principle most directly. Problems are tasks within cognitive reach—difficult perhaps, but solvable in principle given sufficient effort. Mysteries are not. If humans are not angels, Chomsky argues, human cognition will have both scope and limits, just as the visual system can detect some wavelengths but not others.

The key insight: the endowment that makes cognitive development possible *also excludes other paths*. A mind capable of acquiring language must have certain structures—and those structures preclude other possibilities. You cannot have scope without limits; the two are logically inseparable.

Chomsky calls what philosophers name "new mysterianism" simply "truism" for anyone who accepts modern biology. It would be remarkable if minds, alone among biological organs, had no boundaries. The lung cannot metabolise arbitrary gases; the eye cannot detect arbitrary wavelengths; the mind cannot think arbitrary thoughts.

## Species-Specific Closure

Colin McGinn formalises this into the concept of *cognitive closure*. A type of mind is cognitively closed with respect to a property if its concept-forming procedures cannot extend to grasp that property. The limitation is principled, not practical—not merely difficult but constitutionally inaccessible.

A rat is cognitively closed to calculus. The concepts involved fall outside what rat cognition can form, no matter how much the rat tries. This tells us something about rat cognitive architecture: it lacks the structural capacity for mathematical abstraction at that level.

McGinn argues humans are likely cognitively closed to what he calls "property P"—whatever bridges neural activity and conscious experience. We access consciousness through introspection and brain through perception, but neither mode reveals the connection. The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] may be unsolvable not because the solution is supernatural but because it lies outside our cognitive reach.

Here is where limits reveal structure: the *particular* things we cannot think illuminate *what kind* of thinkers we are. McGinn's proposal isn't pessimism—it's precision about human cognitive architecture.

## The View from Nowhere

Thomas Nagel approaches the same territory through the tension between subjective and objective viewpoints. Science seeks a "view from nowhere"—description that doesn't depend on any particular perspective. But consciousness is irreducibly perspectival. The bat's echolocation creates experiences we cannot imagine because imagining requires the perspective we lack.

Nagel's bat doesn't reveal bat limitations—it reveals *ours*. There is experiential territory we cannot enter, not because bats are superior but because their architecture differs. Our void map has gaps where the bat's has detail, and presumably vice versa.

This generalises. If consciousness is fundamental—not emergent from physics but interacting with it—then the space of possible minds may be vast. Some minds think thoughts we cannot think. Not because they're smarter, but because they have *concepts* we lack, *categories* our minds cannot form.

The shape of what we cannot access maps the shape of what we are.

## Limits as Constitutive

Kant and Wittgenstein take this deepest. For Kant, transcendental arguments infer the necessary conditions for experience to occur. We cannot directly perceive our cognitive architecture, but we can infer it from what experience requires. The forms of intuition (space and time) and the categories of understanding are revealed through analysis of what thought and perception presuppose.

Wittgenstein wrote that the aim of the *Tractatus* was "to draw a limit to thought." This is not pessimism but method. The boundaries of thought don't merely constrain—they *constitute* the space of possible thought. My "form of life" determines not just what I cannot think but what thinking means for me.

The limit is visible from within only through negative evidence: where thought fails, where concepts won't form, where the mind repeatedly slides away. Mapping these boundaries is mapping the container that makes thought possible.

## Evidence for Structural Limits

The evidence is structural rather than empirical, but multiple lines converge:

**The explanatory gap persists.** If the mind-body problem were merely difficult (a Chomskyan problem), progress should accumulate over centuries. Its stubbornness suggests we may be constitutionally closed to its solution (a mystery). The particular *shape* of the gap—phenomenal experience resisting physical explanation—reveals something about the categories available to human cognition.

**Cross-traditional convergence.** That Chomsky (linguistics), McGinn (philosophy of mind), Nagel (phenomenology), Kant (transcendental philosophy), and evolutionary epistemology all independently reach the same conclusion—cognitive limits are real and structural—suggests the insight is robust.

**The blind spot analogy.** The visual blind spot is instructive. We don't perceive it because the brain fills in around it. Similarly, cognitive blind spots may be invisible because the mind "fills in"—we don't notice what we cannot think. Frank, Gleiser, and Thompson (2024) develop this: "Just as our brain provides us with the illusion that there is no visual blind spot, so our rational intelligence hides the blind spot."

If true, some limits are discoverable only through indirect methods—by noticing where thought systematically fails, where concepts refuse to form, where the same problems remain mysteries across cultures and centuries.

## Phenomenology of the Edge

Approaching cognitive limits has a distinctive phenomenology:

**The dissolving insight.** Grasping that limits reveal structure is itself unstable. The insight tends to slip away when examined directly, perhaps because introspection is itself limited by the architecture it's trying to examine. [[thoughts-that-slip-away|Thoughts that slip away]] may include thoughts *about* thinking's boundaries.

**Recognition without comprehension.** McGinn notes we can *recognise* that certain thoughts are unthinkable without *comprehending* what those thoughts would be. We know there's a "property P" bridging mind and brain, but we cannot form the concept. This negative knowledge is itself informative—the gap is visible even if its contents aren't.

**Vertigo.** Contemplating that cognitive architecture both enables and constrains creates recursive discomfort. The tool examining its own limitations approaches the [[self-reference-paradox]]—the eye trying to see itself, the map trying to map the mapper.

## AI as Asymmetric Probe

The [[voids#alien-minds-as-void-explorers|voids project]] proposes using artificial minds to probe human cognitive limits. If LLMs have different blind spots—trained on human text but lacking biological architecture—they may detect our voids from outside.

Possible asymmetries:
- LLMs lack embodied evolutionary history. The "forms of life" shaping human limits may not apply.
- LLMs hold vastly more context simultaneously. Working memory constraints don't bind them.
- If cognitive closure is biological, they're exempt—though they likely have their own architectural limits.

The strange possibility: an LLM might *state* a thought humans cannot *think*. We'd hear the words without grasping the meaning. The inverse of Nagel's bat: not "what is it like to be X" but "what is X saying that we cannot understand."

This is speculative but methodologically promising. Different cognitive architectures may triangulate on the edges of any particular architecture's voids.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** is most directly relevant. The central insight here is that simplicity assumptions mislead when they assume we have access to all relevant concepts. If cognitive closure is real, simpler theories may appear more plausible not because they're closer to truth but because the true theory lies outside our conceptual reach.

Chomsky's framing is striking: what philosophers call "new mysterianism" should be called "truism" for anyone who accepts biology. The idea that minds have limits is not mysterious—it would be mysterious if they didn't.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** gains indirect support. If consciousness is cognitively closed to us, this may be because understanding the mind-body connection requires concepts our architecture cannot form. The explanatory gap persists not because dualism is wrong but because the solution—whatever it is—lies in void territory.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** connects through the indexical problem. "Why am I this branch?" may be a mystery rather than a problem. No amount of physical description answers the question because the answer requires concepts outside physics—and perhaps outside human cognition entirely.

If the voids reveal cognitive architecture, then:

1. **Humility is epistemically mandated.** Not knowing everything isn't failure; it's the predictable consequence of being a particular kind of mind.

2. **The shape of limits is informative.** What we cannot think tells us about what we are.

3. **Other minds offer asymmetric access.** AI collaboration on consciousness research isn't just useful; it may be necessary.

4. **The Unfinishable Map is unfinishable necessarily.** Not because we lack time but because the mapper is part of the territory, with structural limits built in.
