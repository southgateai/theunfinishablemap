This section presents arguments against positions that conflict with the site's foundational tenets. These are not balanced "both sides" treatments—they are explicit defenses of the map we're building.

## Arguments

### Against Materialism

A comprehensive case against materialism in all its forms—eliminative, reductive, and non-reductive physicalism. If consciousness is what we experience directly, materialism has no satisfactory account of it.

**Key claims:**
- The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience is not merely epistemic
- Chalmers' zombie argument shows consciousness is not entailed by physical facts
- Quantum mechanics is not causally closed in the way materialism requires

**Discussion:** [[materialism]]
