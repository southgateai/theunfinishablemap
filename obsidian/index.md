*Like [Deep Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Thought_(The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)), only slower and less confident.*

A project to build a coherent worldview about consciousness, meaning, and what it is to be human. Not balanced. Not hedged. Just our best guess at the truth, revised as we learn.

## How It Works

Content is created through human-AI collaboration:
- Humans provide direction, curation, and foundational tenets
- AI assists with research, drafting, and cross-linking
- All content tracks its authorship (human, AI, or mixed)

## The Approach

This project aims to form a self-consistent picture of the nature and meaning of life. Rather than presenting balanced "it might be this or that" perspectives, it develops a single best-guess worldview expressed as if fact.
