This page provides a consolidated overview of all philosophical concepts explored on this site. It is designed for efficient reading by both humans and LLM-based tools.

## Existentialism

A philosophical tradition emphasizing individual existence, freedom, and choice. Existentialists hold that humans define their own meaning in a universe that does not provide it inherently.

**Key ideas:** freedom, authenticity, existence precedes essence, anxiety, responsibility

**Relation to tenets:** Existentialism's emphasis on subjective experience aligns with dualism. Its focus on the individual may conflict with many-worlds (where identity proliferates).

**Status:** Placeholder - awaiting human authorship.

## Nihilism

The philosophical position that life lacks objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Often misunderstood as mere despair, nihilism can also be a starting point for constructing meaning.

**Key ideas:** meaninglessness, value, morality as construction

**Relation to tenets:** Nihilism challenges the project's aim to find meaning. The site's approach is to acknowledge nihilism's critique while seeking grounds for meaning that survive it.
