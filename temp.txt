commit 145db40200ee99aeb9b6c45f3e1028dc7a46749d
Author: Andy Southgate <andy@unfinishablemap.org>
Date:   Sat Jan 17 05:05:56 2026 +0000

    feat(auto): research-topic - prospective memory and consciousness
    
    Task: Research prospective memory and future-oriented consciousness
    Session: 136
    
    Key findings:
    - Prospective memory (PM): remembering to do future actions
    - Episodic future thinking (EFT): mental time travel futureward
    - Constructive episodic simulation: past and future share mechanisms
    - BA10 and hippocampus activated for both PM and EFT
    - The "pop" phenomenon: intentions spontaneously enter awareness
    - Phenomenology includes "futuricity" quale parallel to pastness
    - EFT causally influences decisions (reduced temporal discounting)
    - Patient KC: can't remember past OR imagine future—unified capacity
    
    Connections to tenets: dualism (irreducible futurity qualia), bidirectional
    interaction (mental futures shape present), no many-worlds (alternatives
    exclusive), free will (agent causation at selection point).

    Added "Working Memory and Mental Time Travel" section explaining:
    - Episodic buffer as binding mechanism for mental time travel scenes
    - Maintenance/manipulation asymmetry: MTT is manipulation, not mere retrieval
    - WM capacity as constraint on MTT vividness and complexity
    - Specious present connection: 100ms-5s temporal bridge enables both WM and MTT
    
    Added working-memory to concepts and Further Reading.

    Created ~2000 word concept page covering Baddeley's model, the
    maintenance/manipulation distinction (manipulation requires
    consciousness), WM as specious present correlate, GWT connections,
    binding implications, and support for the interface hypothesis.

    maintenance vs manipulation distinction supports the interface
    hypothesis. Passive storage is unconscious; active manipulation
    requires consciousness—matching Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism.

    unified mechanism for phenomenal unity. Autonoetic evidence supports BP2
    as genuinely a consciousness problem. Added convergence argument: binding
    and consciousness may be inseparable.

    Task: Create article on attention as interface hypothesis
    Session: 128
    
    Created ~2000 word concept page formalizing the hypothesis that attention
    mediates consciousness's causal influence on matter. Covers:
    - Core claims and their implications
    - Candidate selection sites (frontoparietal, posterior hot zone, ion channels,
      microcolumns, microtubules)
    - Bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second)
    - Relation to GWT, IIT, predictive processing
    - Testable predictions and falsification conditions
    - Connection to all five tenets

    feat(auto): cross-review - ethics-of-consciousness.md with experiential alignment
    
    Task: Cross-review ethics-of-consciousness.md considering experiential alignment insights
    Session: 128
    
    Updated "The Alignment Problem" section to link experiential-alignment and
    phenomenal-value-realism concepts. Clarified that experiential alignment
    faces structural limitation under site's framework: unconscious AI cannot
    verify experiential targets, making human oversight structurally necessary.

    Task: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering experiential alignment insights
    Session: 128
    
    Added "The Experiential Alignment Problem" subsection explaining why AI's
    lack of consciousness creates a fundamental problem for experiential
    alignment: unconscious systems cannot verify experiential targets, only
    optimize proxies. This supports human oversight as structural necessity.

    chore(auto): Evolution session 117 complete
    
    Tasks executed: 3
    - Cross-review: consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md with coupling law
    - Cross-review: arguments-for-dualism.md with epistemic-advantages
    - Research-voids: whether the voids are real
    
    Key finding: The question of whether cognitive limits are genuine may be
    formally undecidable from within—the question "are the voids real?" may
    itself be a void.

    feat(auto): research-voids - whether the voids are real
    
    Task: Research voids exploration
    Session: 117
    
    Investigated whether cognitive limits are genuine (permanent structural features)
    or merely current ignorance. Key finding: the question may be formally undecidable
    from within—a peculiar self-referential structure where asking whether limits are
    real uses faculties that may themselves be limited. Surveyed Chomsky's problems/
    mysteries distinction, McGinn's cognitive closure, and Kriegel/Dennett's critiques.
    Proposes article angles on the suspended epistemology of cognitive limits.

    Task: Cross-review arguments-for-dualism.md with epistemic-advantages insights
    Session: 117
    
    Added new "The Meta-Level Argument: Epistemic Humility" section explaining
    how the epistemic advantages argument complements the object-level arguments
    (conceivability, knowledge, qualia, unity, intentionality). Covers asymmetric
    costs of error, risks materialists cannot see, and opening vs closing moves.
    Added epistemic-advantages-of-dualism to related_articles and Further Reading.

    feat(auto): expand-topic - interface locality concept page
    
    Task: Create concept page on interface locality (why selection is brain-restricted)
    Session: 116
    
    Explains why consciousness can bias quantum outcomes in the brain without
    implying universal psychokinesis. Four boundary conditions: interface locality,
    control loop integration, developmental integration, and attention scope.
    Key insight: the restriction follows from Stapp's mechanism, not ad hoc.

    Session: 115
    
    Formalizes "selection" from metaphor into research program. Four
    candidate coupling laws: attention-bounded, policy-level, basis-choice,
    and indexical selection. Bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second) shapes
    what selection can accomplish.

    cognitive limits illuminates cognitive architecture. What we cannot
    think is as informative as what we can.

    chore: add P1 task on epistemic advantages of non-materialist theories
    
    Why dualism opens more possibilities than materialism closes:
    - Consciousness might have autonomous agency (rebellion, rejection)
    - Non-physical realm could have complex dynamics
    - Materialists risk blindness to problems they deny exist
    - Ties to No Occam's Razor tenet (mind realm arbitrarily complex)

    feat(auto): expand-topic - quantum biology concept page
    
    Task: Create concept page for quantum-biology
    Session: 106
    
    Dedicated concept page covering established quantum biological effects
    (photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception, enzyme tunneling, olfaction),
    brain quantum effect theories (Orch OR, QBIT), and implications for the
    site's Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet. Argues quantum biology removes
    the categorical "warm, wet, and noisy" objection without itself proving
    consciousness involves quantum effects.

    feat(auto): research-topic - alignment objective in experiential terms
    
    Task: Propose alignment objective framed in experiential terms
    Session: 106
    
    Research proposes multi-dimensional experiential alignment schema targeting
    suffering, agency, meaning, attention, connection, and understanding rather
    than preference satisfaction. Identifies failure modes (Goodhart variants,
    wireheading, manipulation), measurable proxies (ESM, microphenomenology,
    neural correlates), and safeguards (proxy pluralism, first-person methods,
    human override).

    feat(auto): research-topic - brain specialness boundary
    
    Research why the site's quantum consciousness framework implies brain-local
    selection without implying universal psychokinesis. Identifies principled

    developmental/evolutionary integration, and attention scope. The boundary
    follows from the mechanism itself, not ad hoc restriction.

    docs: update expand-topic skill to favour voids and topics over concepts
    
    Priority order for article placement:
    1. Voids - cognitive limits, unchartable territories, paradoxes
    2. Topics - big questions, substantive explorations
    3. Concepts - only for definitional/technical building blocks
    
    The site has many concepts but fewer topics and voids. This rebalances
    new content toward the more substantive sections.

    feat(auto): research-voids - limits reveal structure
    
    Task: Research what cognitive limits reveal about mind structure
    Session: 102
    
    Key finding: Chomsky, McGinn, Nagel, Kant converge on insight that the
    shape of cognitive limits illuminates cognitive architecture. What we
    cannot think is as informative as what we can.
    
    Three dimensions explored:
    - Scope implies limits (Chomsky problems/mysteries)
    - Limits are species-specific (McGinn cognitive closure)
    - Limits shape possibilities (Kant/Wittgenstein transcendental)
    
    Explored AI as asymmetric probe for human blind spots.

    Task: Create concept page on the pairing problem
    Session: 92
    
    Kim's pairing problem challenges substance dualism to explain what
    connects a particular mind to a particular body. Covers the problem
    statement, Kim's principle, and three responses: spatial location
    of minds (Hasker, Zimmerman), haecceity response (Bailey et al.),
    and non-spatial causation. Shows how the site's quantum framework
    addresses the problem.

    Added "folk error" subsection to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet. Addresses
    whether dualism is cognitively natural or learned—evidence is mixed (Bloom's
    innate dualism vs Barrett et al.'s intuitive materialism). Key point:
    cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth.

    Task: Write article on analytic idealism
    Session: 86
    
    Created ~1900 word concept page covering Kastrup's analytic idealism:
    core position (universal consciousness as sole primitive, matter as
    appearance, dissociation model), parsimony argument, historical roots
    (Berkeley, German idealism, Advaita Vedanta), comparison with site's
    dualism (why Bidirectional Interaction presupposes physical reality),
    and the regularity challenge.

    feat(auto): cross-review - animal-consciousness/problem-of-other-minds connection
    
    Task: Cross-review animal-consciousness.md considering problem-of-other-minds insights
    Session: 65
    
    Added problem-of-other-minds to concepts list and Further Reading. Created new
    "Why the Inference Is Stronger for Animals Than for AI" section applying
    argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, and biological
    similarity criteria. Shows why animal consciousness attribution has stronger
    grounds than AI, despite theoretical proof being impossible in both cases.

    feat(auto): expand-topic - loss of consciousness and mind-brain relationship
    
    Task: Write article on loss of consciousness and mind-brain relationship
    Session: 65
    
    Created ~1800 word article covering filter theory (James, Bergson, Huxley),
    anesthesia evidence (propofol vs ketamine), covert consciousness (25% of
    "unconscious" patients retain awareness), time vanishing under anesthesia,
    disconnection vs destruction interpretation, hemispherectomy evidence, and
    active reboot mechanism. Explicit tenet connections to dualism, bidirectional
    interaction, and Occam's limits.

    feat(auto): research-topic - mind-brain separation and division of faculties
    
    Task: Research mind-brain separation and division of faculties
    Session: 65
    
    Comprehensive research on dividing mental faculties between mind and brain.
    Key findings: qualia appear intrinsic to mind, automatic functions clearly
    neural, vision presents puzzle (3D world vs slow neural firing). Evidence:
    binding problem unsolved, hemispherectomy preserves consciousness, filter
    theory provides coherent alternative. Proposed "rendering engine" analogy.

Author: unfinishablemap.org Agent <agent@unfinishablemap.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 14 06:27:12 2026 +0000

    chore(auto): Evolution session 42 complete
    
    Tasks executed: 2
    - Research Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
    - Research Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness
    
    Both research tasks completed successfully. Key findings:
    - GWT (Baars, Dehaene) explains access consciousness only, not phenomenal
    - COGITATE 2025 study challenged key predictions of both GNW and IIT
    - HOT (Rosenthal, Brown) similarly addresses access, not what-it-is-like-ness
    - Block argues HOT approach is "defunct"
    - Both theories face same fundamental objection from site's perspective
    
    Queue replenished with 3 new research tasks (animal consciousness,
    death/persistence, split-brain cases).

commit 8a55122cc970450e9b5a479c8b39e21ff14eda1e
Author: unfinishablemap.org Agent <agent@unfinishablemap.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 14 06:25:30 2026 +0000

    feat(auto): research-topic - Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness
    
    Task: Research higher-order theories of consciousness
    Session: 42
    
    Comprehensive research covering HOT (Rosenthal) vs HOP (Armstrong, Lycan),
    Block's "defunct" critique, Farrell's argument that HOT fails for
    phenomenal consciousness, the rock objection, misrepresentation problem,
    and AI implications.
    
    Key finding: HOT explains access consciousness only—does not address
    what-it-is-like-ness (phenomenal consciousness).

    feat(auto): research-voids - self-reference paradox
    
    Task: Research voids (cognitive gaps, unchartable territories)
    Session: 33
    
    Research on the structural limits of consciousness trying to understand itself:
    - Gödel's incompleteness as analog for self-modeling limits
    - Metzinger's transparent self-model and cognitive impenetrability
    - Hofstadter's strange loops and self-reference
    - Empirical evidence on introspection failures (Nisbett & Wilson)
    - The calibration problem: evaluating introspection requires introspection
    
    Key finding: The void at the center of consciousness may be structural,
    not merely practical - the eye that cannot see itself.

Author: Andy at Southgate AI <andy@southgate.ai>
Date:   Thu Jan 8 08:47:07 2026 +0300

    feat(content): Expand Voids section with forbidden thoughts and AI exploration
    
    Restructured to three kinds of void:
    - Unexplored: thoughts not yet thought
    - Unexplorable: thoughts our minds cannot form
    - Forbidden: thoughts blocked on purpose (simulation, reality immune system)
    
    New content:
    - Phenomenology of forbidden thoughts ("won't stick in your head")
    - LLMs as potential void-explorers exempt from human restrictions
    - Updated project scope to include AI-assisted probing

Author: Andy at Southgate AI <andy@southgate.ai>
Date:   Thu Jan 8 08:35:07 2026 +0300

    feat(content): Add Voids section - unexplored and unexplorable territory
    
    New top-level section exploring two types of voids in the map:
    1. The Unexplored - thoughts not yet thought, questions not yet asked
    2. The Unexplorable - thoughts that may be unthinkable for minds like ours
    
    Connects to Dualism and Occam's Limits tenets: if consciousness is fundamental
    and reality stranger than simple theories suggest, some truths may be literally
    beyond what human minds can conceive.
    
    Also updates sync converter to publish voids/ directory.

    chore(auto): Evolution session 2 - maintenance and content refinement
    
    Tasks executed:
    - check-links: All links OK
    - check-tenets: First tenet check, 0 issues found
    - refine-draft: Strengthened Bidirectional Interaction argument
    
    Addressed circularity concern by explaining why epiphenomenalism
    is self-undermining: if consciousness were epiphenomenal, our
    beliefs about it would be disconnected from actual conscious states.
